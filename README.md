# AWS Cloud Control Collection for Ansible
The AWS Cloud Control Collection is an experimental alpha collection of generated modules using the Cloud Control API for interacting with AWS Services.

This work is being made available for research purposes on the Cloud Control API and community feedback on the user experience of API generated module like these. Therefore, this content is not intended for production in its current state.

<!--start requires_ansible-->
## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.13.0**.

Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.
<!--end requires_ansible-->

## Python version compatibility

This collection requires Python 3.9 or greater.

## AWS SDK version compatibility

Version 0.3.0 of this collection supports `boto3 >= 1.25.0` and `botocore >= 1.28.0`

## Included content

## Installing this collection

You can install the AWS Cloud Control Collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:
```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.cloud
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: amazon.cloud
```

The python module dependencies are not installed by `ansible-galaxy`.  They can
be manually installed using pip:

    pip install requirements.txt

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.cloud --upgrade
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.


## Using this collection

You can either call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `amazon.cloud.logs_log_group`, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the `amazon.cloud` collection in the playbook's `collections` keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Create log group (check mode)
    amazon.cloud.logs_log_group:
      state: present
      log_group_name: "{{ log_group_name }}"
      retention_in_days: 7
      tags:
        testkey: "testvalue"
    register: log_group
```

Because modules may keep the same name in the `amazon.cloud`, `amazon.aws` and `community.aws` collections, we recommend using the FQCN.

For example, if you want to use the s3_bucket module without specyfing the FQDN, it will use the order the collections are listed and take the first matching module it finds (in this case, s3_bucket from `amazon.aws`).

```yaml
---
  - hosts: localhost
    collections:
      - amazon.aws
      - amazon.cloud
    tasks:
      - s3_bucket:
          bucket_name: "..."
```

## Developement

This collection can be generated using the [content_builder](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible.content_builder) tool. Please refer to the [cloud_content generation section](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible.content_builder#4-amazoncloud).

This tool can generate the api specification files and use them to generate the modules. The developer can use the [api specification](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud/api_specifications) files and the [modules.yaml](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud/modules.yaml) file hosted in this repository. The path to these files should be provided as input to the content builder tool to generate the schema and modules. To get more details on the command and input arguments please refer to the tool's [README](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible.content_builder#resource-module-scaffolding-generated-using-openapi-based-json).

This collection is tested using GitHub Actions. To know more on testing, refer to [CI.md](https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.cloud/blob/main/CI,md).

## Known issues

* Modules are only as good as the API and its schema. Documentation may not be complete for all the modules' options and suboptions.
* Missing supportability for important AWS resources like, EC2 instance, RDS instance, EC2 volume, Elastic Load Balancer, RDS Snapshot, EC2 snapshot, etc.
* Idempotency is a function of the API and may not be fully supported.
* Missing server-side pagination. This may have severe impact on performance.
* Name-based identification filtering to support desired state (idempotency) logic is absent. This limitation has made us to exclude several resources and reduce the numebr of modules. A client-side filtering will definitely have a large impact on performance.
* Not all the resources support the available states. In practice this means that some resources cannot be updated or listed.
